# text-editor-pwa
An API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to their friends thoughts, and create a friends list of their own

## Description

- I was motivated to create this application because it was a great opportunity to learn all about creating Progressive Web Apps. Progressive Web Apps were a brand new concept for me so it was interesting to learn about and be able to build something new.
- I created this project to work on my MongoDB, Express.js, and Javascript skills. I think this was a great way for me to get familiar with the more professional and standard way of completing these projects.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of creating a backend that allows for relationships between two things on a blog site.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using MongoDB and plan to keep building projects to build on my knowledge!

## Installation

- In order to use this application, the user will need to have access to the command line.
- Once they are in the command line, they will need to cd into the social-network-mongodb folder.
- Once in the folder, the user will have to run npm start in the command line.
- From there, the user will be able to use Insomnia to use the routes created through Mongoose
