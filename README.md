# text-editor-pwa
A Progressive Web Application text editor.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this application because it was a great opportunity to learn all about creating Progressive Web Apps. Progressive Web Apps were a brand new concept for me so it was interesting to learn about and be able to build something new.
- I created this project to work on Progressive Web Application and deployment skilsl. I think this was a great way for me to get familiar with the way progressive web applications are created, which was a great opportunity for me to do so.
- By creating this application, I solved the issue of learning how Progressive Web Applications work.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using Progressive Web Applications and was able to see their use in real world applications!
